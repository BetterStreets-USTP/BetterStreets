## 1.6.1 Scope of the Study

The scope of this study is to design, develop, and test BetterStreets Camaman-an, a mobile and web-based community issue reporting system intended to improve the reporting, documentation, and management of barangay-level concerns in Barangay Camaman-an, Cagayan de Oro City. The system is developed as a capstone prototype and is intended for local testing and academic evaluation. It provides a structured reporting platform for residents and a centralized management interface for barangay personnel to support more organized handling of community reports.

This study includes the development of an Android mobile application for residents that allows users to submit reports with complete information such as titles, descriptions, photo evidence (up to 5 images per report), and GPS-based location data. The mobile application supports offline-capable use through local caching using AsyncStorage, allowing users to view cached data, preserve drafts, and store reports temporarily when internet connectivity is unavailable, with synchronization once the connection is restored. The scope also includes a web-based administrative dashboard for barangay personnel that supports report review, verification, categorization, assignment to designated barangay units (7 internal departments: Maintenance Team, Sanitation, Traffic Management, Engineering, Health Services, Peace and Order, and Social Welfare), status updates with remarks, announcement publishing, and case closure through an organized workflow.

In addition, the system includes key implemented features that support transparency and decision support. These include keyword-based rule-driven auto-classification of reports into 8 predefined categories (Road Damage, Street Lighting, Garbage/Waste, Drainage/Flooding, Illegal Activity, Public Safety, Infrastructure, and Other), automatic status timeline tracking with complete status history and audit trail, push notifications via Expo Push Notification Service and an in-app notification center with unread badge tracking for report updates and announcements, heatmap visualization using OpenStreetMap with color-coded markers and geographic clustering, full-screen photo viewer with zoom capabilities, profile management allowing residents to update personal information and notification preferences, and an analytics dashboard showing report statistics, status breakdown, category distribution, priority analysis, and barangay unit performance metrics.

The backend infrastructure is built using Node.js with Express framework and MongoDB database with Mongoose ODM, implementing RESTful API architecture with JWT-based authentication, file upload handling via Multer with validation and secure storage, and push notification integration using expo-server-sdk. The study also covers the preparation of technical documentation and system models required for capstone presentation, including the system architecture diagram, entity-relationship diagram with 4 database collections (users, reports, categories, announcements), API endpoint documentation, and process modeling outputs such as use case diagrams, context diagrams, and data flow diagrams. System testing and evaluation are conducted under local testing conditions through usability testing with actual barangay residents and administrative personnel, and technical testing procedures such as functionality testing (feature completeness, form validation, authentication), reliability testing (error handling, data integrity), and performance checks (response time, offline synchronization, notification delivery) based on the scope of the prototype.

## 1.6.2 Limitations of the Study

This study is limited to Barangay Camaman-an and does not include implementation in other barangays or city-wide deployment. The resident-facing mobile application is developed for Android devices only (requiring Android 5.0 Lollipop or higher), and an iOS version is not included based on the scope and constraints set by the capstone adviser and development resources available. The system is developed primarily for academic purposes and local testing environment, and it is not intended for immediate public deployment or cloud hosting. As a result, long-term operational performance, continuous real-world usage beyond the testing period, scalability under high user loads, and full integration into official barangay operational policies are outside the scope of this study.

The offline-capable functionality of the mobile application is limited to local caching using AsyncStorage, which supports offline access to stored data and temporary storage of drafts or reports when connectivity is unstable. Full offline operation for all system modules may be constrained by device-specific storage limitations (AsyncStorage capacity varies by device) and requires internet connection for photo uploads and synchronization when connectivity is restored. The system does not include conflict resolution mechanisms for simultaneous edits made offline by multiple users. Location accuracy also depends on the GPS capabilities of the user's device and surrounding environmental conditions such as urban density, weather conditions, and satellite visibility, which may affect the precision of location tagging and map-based visualization outputs such as the heatmap. GPS coordinates are captured at the time of report submission only and do not include continuous location tracking or field worker routing features.

User management is simplified for prototype purposes, with admin accounts created manually via backend script rather than through a self-service registration system. New resident accounts require email verification through a 6-digit one-time password (OTP) sent via nodemailer and Gmail SMTP, with 10-minute expiration and 1-minute rate limiting for resend requests to prevent spam. The system includes email verification for security and account authenticity, but does not include password recovery or reset functionality through email, or multi-factor authentication beyond the initial OTP verification. Role-based access control is limited to two user types (resident and admin) without hierarchical permission levels or granular access controls. In addition, while the system includes assignment to designated barangay units for handling reports, it does not include external system integration with third-party agencies, city-level government platforms, or inter-barangay data sharing capabilities. The assignment function is informational and does not include automated dispatch, real-time field worker coordination, route optimization, or task completion verification by external personnel.

The notification system is limited to push notifications delivered through Expo Push Notification Service and does not include SMS notifications via third-party services such as Twilio or email notifications through SMTP servers. Notification delivery depends on user permission grants, device notification settings, and stable internet connectivity. The system also does not include advanced analytics features such as predictive modeling using machine learning, automated trend forecasting, or natural language processing for sentiment analysis of report descriptions. Data export capabilities are limited to on-screen viewing and do not include PDF report generation, CSV data exports, or scheduled automated reporting.

File storage is handled through the local uploads directory on the backend server rather than cloud storage solutions such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, which limits scalability and does not include automated backup systems or disaster recovery procedures. Photo uploads are limited to 5 images per report with a maximum file size of 5MB per image, supporting JPEG and PNG formats only. The database runs on localhost MongoDB rather than a managed cloud database service such as MongoDB Atlas, which means the system lacks built-in replication, automated backups, and high availability configurations suitable for production environments.

Language support is limited to English only, and the system does not include localization for Bisaya, Tagalog, or other regional languages commonly used in the area. Accessibility features for users with disabilities, such as screen reader compatibility, text-to-speech support, voice input, or dynamic font scaling, are not implemented in this prototype. The user interface follows standard design patterns without specialized accessibility accommodations beyond basic responsive design principles.

Finally, evaluation results are limited by the time constraints of a one-semester capstone project, the resources available for testing (hardware, software licenses, participant incentives), and respondent availability among barangay residents and administrative personnel during the designated testing period. Large-scale testing with hundreds of concurrent users, extended monitoring over multiple months to observe seasonal patterns or long-term usage trends, comprehensive security auditing and penetration testing, or formal certification processes for government system compliance are not covered in this study. The testing environment is restricted to local network deployment without exposure to real-world internet security threats, DDoS attacks, or malicious user behavior that would be encountered in public deployment scenarios.
