4.6. System Usability Scale Results


To evaluate the usability and user acceptance of the BetterStreets system, the System Usability Scale (SUS) was administered to all testing respondents following their interaction with the system. The SUS, developed by Brooke (1996), is a widely-used standardized questionnaire that provides a reliable and quick method for assessing perceived system usability. This section presents the SUS questionnaire administered to respondents and the calculated usability scores obtained from the evaluation.

4.6.1. System Usability Questionnaire


The System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire consists of ten standardized statements designed to measure users' subjective assessment of system usability. Respondents rate each statement using a 5-point Likert scale, where 1 indicates "Strongly Disagree" and 5 indicates "Strongly Agree." The questionnaire alternates between positively and negatively worded statements to reduce response bias. Table 16 presents the ten SUS statements administered to the 20 respondents following their interaction with the BetterStreets system.

| QUESTIONS | STRONGLY DISAGREE | DISAGREE | NEUTRAL | AGREE | STRONGLY AGREE |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|---------|-------|----------------|
| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently | | | | | |
| 2. I found the system unnecessarily complex. | | | | | |
| 3. I thought the system was easy to use. | | | | | |
| 4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system. | | | | | |
| 5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated | | | | | |
| 6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system. | | | | | |
| 7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly. | | | | | |
| 8. I found the system very cumbersome to use. | | | | | |
| 9. I felt very confident using the system. | | | | | |
| 10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system. | | | | | |

4.6.2. System Usability Score 


Individual SUS scores were calculated for each respondent by first converting their responses to a 0-4 scale, summing the converted values, and multiplying the total by 2.5 to obtain a final score ranging from 0 to 100. Table 17 presents the individual responses of all 20 respondents across the ten SUS questions (Q1-Q10), along with their raw scores and final SUS scores. The table also displays the overall system average SUS score at the bottom, providing a comprehensive view of the BetterStreets system's perceived usability.

4.6.3. Interpretation of System Usability Scale (SUS) Score 


To further interpret the usability level of the BetterStreets system, the average System Usability Scale (SUS) score was evaluated using the standard SUS letter grade and percentile ranking. Table 18 presents the SUS score interpretation based on corresponding score ranges, letter grades, and percentile rankings commonly used in usability evaluation studies.










Table 18. Letter Grade to Describe SUS Scores.

The BetterStreets system achieved an average SUS score of 76.88, which corresponds to a B usability rating and falls within the 70–79 percentile range based on the SUS interpretation scale. This score indicates good perceived usability and suggests that the system is acceptable and usable for its intended users. Individual respondent scores ranged from 40.0 to 100.0, with 16 out of 20 respondents (80%) obtaining scores equal to or above the standard SUS acceptability threshold of 68, indicating strong user acceptance of the system for community issue reporting and resolution.
